2026-01-16: for the sddm login screen we need to be able to select a user too
2026-01-16: also it should show if capslock is pressed
2026-01-16: is the sddm hardcoded to my timlinux user
2026-01-16: when I deployed and rebooted i did not see the arrows just my hard coded user name. running the theme in test mode does show it
2026-01-16: Add SDDM config to show more users (if you have other accounts that should appear)
2026-01-16: can it also allow manually typing in a user name
2026-01-16: ok you just need to move the two input boxes down so they do not cover the date
set up hyprlandPlugins.hyprexpo in my configuration
After applying the last change to add hyprexpo, hyprland fails to start properly. Please check the deployed config is correct, fixing any issues as needed
ok commit and deploy
