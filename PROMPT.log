2026-01-16: for the sddm login screen we need to be able to select a user too
2026-01-16: also it should show if capslock is pressed
2026-01-16: is the sddm hardcoded to my timlinux user
2026-01-16: when I deployed and rebooted i did not see the arrows just my hard coded user name. running the theme in test mode does show it
2026-01-16: Add SDDM config to show more users (if you have other accounts that should appear)
2026-01-16: can it also allow manually typing in a user name
2026-01-16: ok you just need to move the two input boxes down so they do not cover the date
set up hyprlandPlugins.hyprexpo in my configuration
After applying the last change to add hyprexpo, hyprland fails to start properly. Please check the deployed config is correct, fixing any issues as needed
ok commit and deploy
its still not loading - check the logs again - also check the deployment to /etc/xdg matches your expected setup for hyprland plugins
how can I use those nice vectorised hyprland cursors
look at screenshot.png for the errors I now get when starting my wayland session
are our hyprcursor changes in effect now too?

address the errors in screenshot.png
Fix config errors: hyprexpo:expo invalid dispatcher and windowrulev2 deprecated syntax
Config error in file /etc/xdg/hypr/conf/windowrules/default.conf at line 23: invalid field float: missing a value
Config error in file /etc/xdg/hypr/conf/windowrules/default.conf at line 24: invalid field pin: missing a value
...
ok now lets reinstate the hyprexpo plugin integrated again
lets make the cursor a bit bigger and make sure we are using hyprcursors
User prompt: it seems we should be using a new way to start hyprland
User followup: its something line hyprland start
User followup: see screenshot.png (shows warning: Hyprland was started without start-hyprland. This is highly not recommended unless you a...)
User followup: did you make sure it is loading the config from /etc/xdf/hypr/....
the new timesheet widget I added is not showing on the waybar:

that is looking good in terms of the widget shows on the waybar and I can see the time display, but I cannot see the icon

And the session time shows 32 hours rather than 32 minutes
I think it will prefer a neutral colour when the timer is running (kartoza blue) and a warning colour when it is stopped
can you see why my waybar flashes slightly - is there some kind of cycling colour intensity change happening in the background?
the timesheet display should only show hours and minutes and polling should be at minute intervals
I think we can reduce PROD and GSH to a simple P and G icon - could you find some nice little nerdfont icons with a circle with the letter in it for each
also the screen recorder is there a nerdfont for a video camera we can use rather
for the battery status, lets move the % level into the tooltip and use nerdfont icons and colours to should the fill status. it should flash when it is below 15%
for the brightness are there a series of nerdfonts that can show different brightness levels and we move the % indicator into the tooltip
for the battery lets use different nerdfonts to show the fill levels and move the temperature read out to a tooltip
fir the memory can we show a little nerdfont pie chard next to it instead of the gb text (whcih can move into the tooltip). The pie chart would show relatice utilisation of the free vs total ram
those temperature icons should be nerdfonts
for the volume can you use a series of symbolic nerdfonts to show volume leves and remove the % text after the icon (which can move to the tooltip)
