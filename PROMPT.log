2026-01-16: for the sddm login screen we need to be able to select a user too
2026-01-16: also it should show if capslock is pressed
2026-01-16: is the sddm hardcoded to my timlinux user
2026-01-16: when I deployed and rebooted i did not see the arrows just my hard coded user name. running the theme in test mode does show it
2026-01-16: Add SDDM config to show more users (if you have other accounts that should appear)
2026-01-16: can it also allow manually typing in a user name
2026-01-16: ok you just need to move the two input boxes down so they do not cover the date

look at screenshot.png for the errors I now get when starting my wayland session

ok now lets reinstate the hyprexpo plugin integrated again
lets make the cursor a bit bigger and make sure we are using hyprcursors
User prompt: it seems we should be using a new way to start hyprland
User followup: its something line hyprland start
User followup: see screenshot.png (shows warning: Hyprland was started without start-hyprland. This is highly not recommended unless you a...)
User followup: did you make sure it is loading the config from /etc/xdf/hypr/....
